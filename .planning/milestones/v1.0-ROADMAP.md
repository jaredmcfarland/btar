# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-17
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 21

## Overview

Transform existing codebases into agent-ready environments through systematic analysis and remediation. BTAR provides CLI-based measurement of the Foundation Tier metrics (type strictness, lint errors, test coverage), generates agent context files (AGENTS.md), and produces actionable remediation plans. The journey moves from understanding what's in the codebase (Phase 1-2), to scoring and CI integration (Phase 3), to generating context and hooks (Phase 4), to automated fixing (Phase 5).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: CLI scaffolding, language detection, basic config
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding
- [x] 01-02: Config loader (TDD)
- [x] 01-03: Language detector (TDD)
- [x] 01-04: CLI integration

**Details:**
- Commander.js CLI with `btar` command
- 9 languages supported (TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript)
- `.btar.yaml` configuration with deep merge defaults
- Progress reporter with quiet mode
- 39 tests passing

### Phase 2: Core Metrics

**Goal**: Type strictness, lint errors, coverage measurement
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Metric types and tool runner
- [x] 02-02: Type strictness measurement (TDD)
- [x] 02-03: Lint errors measurement (TDD)
- [x] 02-04: Coverage measurement (TDD)
- [x] 02-05: Metrics integration

**Details:**
- Subprocess runner with timeout handling
- Type checker parsers (tsc, mypy, go vet)
- Linter parsers (eslint, ruff, golangci-lint, rubocop, phpcs, ktlint, swiftlint, checkstyle)
- Coverage parsers (c8, pytest-cov, go test, jacoco)
- Per-dimension breakdown in output
- 96 tests passing

### Phase 3: Scoring Engine

**Goal**: Composite scoring, CI integration, quality gates
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Scoring algorithm (TDD)
- [x] 03-02: JSON output format
- [x] 03-03: Quality gates (--fail-under)
- [x] 03-04: GitHub Actions integration (init-ci)

**Details:**
- Logarithmic decay scoring formula (0-100)
- Score interpretations: excellent (90+), good (70-89), needs-work (50-69), poor (<50)
- JSON output with AnalysisOutput type
- `--fail-under N` quality gate with exit code 1
- `btar init-ci` command generates GitHub Actions workflow
- Example workflow in `.github/workflows/btar.yml`
- 17 tests passing

### Phase 4: Context Generation

**Goal**: AGENTS.md validation/generation, hook generation
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: AGENTS.md validation and generation (TDD)
- [x] 04-02: Pre-commit config generator
- [x] 04-03: Claude Code hooks generator
- [x] 04-04: CLI context command integration

**Details:**
- AGENTS.md validator checks required sections (Build, Test, Style)
- AGENTS.md generator with language-specific commands
- Pre-commit config with base hooks + language-specific hooks
- Claude Code hooks (PreToolUse for type check, PostToolUse for analysis)
- `btar context validate/generate` subcommands
- 54 tests passing

### Phase 5: Remediation

**Goal**: Recommendations, ratchet mode, auto-fix delegation
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Tier-based recommendations engine (TDD)
- [x] 05-02: Ratchet mode score persistence (TDD)
- [x] 05-03: Fix command with language tool delegation
- [x] 05-04: CLI integration (recommendations + ratchet)

**Details:**
- P0-P3 tiered recommendations based on score interpretation
- Ratchet mode with `.btar-score` baseline file
- `--save-baseline` and `--ratchet` flags
- `btar fix` command delegates to native tools (eslint --fix, ruff --fix, gofmt -w, etc.)
- Recommendations in both text and JSON output
- 75 tests passing

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Generalizable over Mixpanel-specific (Rationale: Broader utility)
- Decision: Foundation Tier as v1 scope (Rationale: Establishes floor)
- Decision: Per-dimension scoring with rollup (Rationale: Identifies specific gaps)
- Decision: Logarithmic decay scoring (Rationale: Penalizes first errors heavily)
- Decision: Delegate fix to native tools (Rationale: Leverage existing tooling)

**Issues Resolved:**

- All 19 v1 requirements implemented and verified
- 5 phases, 21 plans, ~100 tasks completed
- 281 tests passing

**Issues Deferred:**

- Multi-language project testing (human verification)
- Mutation score metrics (v2)
- CI feedback time measurement (v2)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — all implementations are complete and substantive.
